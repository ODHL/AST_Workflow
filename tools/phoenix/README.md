For full documentation on the pipeline see the [Wiki](https://github.com/cdcent/phoenix/wiki), but quick start instructions are provided below if you are feeling brave. 

# Quick Start

1. Install [`Nextflow`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation) (`>=21.10.3`). 

   There are several options for install if you do not already have it on your system:

   * Install into conda environment, which will require a version of Anaconda to be installed on your system.

       ```console
       mamba create -n nextflow -c bioconda nextflow=21.10.6  
       ```

      <!---```console
       mamba create -n nextflow -c bioconda -c conda-forge nf-core=2.2 nextflow=21.10.6 git=2.35.0 openjdk=8.0.312 graphviz
       ```--->

   * If you prefer a to use `curl` or `wget` for install see the [Nextflow Documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html) 

2. Install [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) or [`Singularity >=3.8.0`](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/) for full pipeline reproducibility. 

3. For PHoeNIx >=2.0.0 you will need to download the public Standard-8 version kraken2 database **created on or after March 14th, 2023** from [Ben Langmead's github page](https://benlangmead.github.io/aws-indexes/k2). **You CANNOT use an older version of the public kraken databases** on Ben Langmead's github page. We thank @BenLangmead and @jenniferlu717 for taking the time to include an extra file in public kraken databases created after March 14th, 2023 to allow them to work in PHoeNIx! **You CANNOT use the old database downloaded from CDC’s sharefile.** The pipeline is not backwards compatible (hence the bump to version 2). 

4. (optional) If you installed nextflow via a conda environment activate the nextflow environment with:  

    ```console
    conda activate <environment name>
    ```

5. Run PHoeNIx on a test sample loaded with the package with a single command:

    ```console
    nextflow run cdcgov/phoenix -r v2.0.0 -profile <singularity/docker/custom>,test -entry PHOENIX --kraken2db $PATH_TO_DB
    ```

Note that this command clones (downloading) the repo to `~/.nextflow/assets/cdcgov/phoenix`. See [wiki](https://github.com/CDCgov/phoenix/wiki/Dependencies-and-Install#run-phoenix) for how to clone and have the software downloaded to a different location. 

    > * The pipeline comes with config profiles called `docker` and `singularity` which instruct the pipeline to use the named tool for software management. For example, `-profile test,docker`.
    > * Please check [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation) to see if a custom config file to run nf-core pipelines already exists for your Institute. If so, you can simply use `-profile <institute>` in your command. This will enable either `docker` or `singularity` and set the appropriate execution settings for your local compute environment.
 
6. Start running your own analysis with a [samplesheet](https://github.com/cdcent/phoenix/wiki/Running-PHoeNIx#samplesheet-input)!

    ```console
    nextflow run cdcgov/phoenix -r v2.0.0 -profile <singularity/docker/custom> -entry PHOENIX --input <path_to_samplesheet.csv> --kraken2db $PATH_TO_DB
    ```
